# Text Analysis Program

## Description

Text Analysis Program was one of my first projects at university. It's a basic C# console application that analyses user-inputted text. 
The program provides insights such as the number of sentences, vowels, uppercase and lowercase letters, and digits present in the text. It is designed to demonstrate fundamental string manipulation techniques in C#.

## Features

- Counts the number of sentences in the input text.
- Counts the number of vowels.
- Counts the number of consonants.
- Counts uppercase characters.
- Counts lowercase characters.
- Counts digits (0-9).
- Counts letter frequency.
- Counts the number of long words (more than 7 letters).
